Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by 
machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI 
include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition 
and machine vision. 
How does AI work? 
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to 
promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as 
AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a 
foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training 
machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is 
synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular. 
In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training 
data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these 
patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that 
is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with 
people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe 
objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. 
AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and 
self-correction. 
Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring 
data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable 
information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing 
devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task. 
Within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there are two basic 
approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The main 
difference is one uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the 
other does not. However, there are some nuances between the two 
approaches, and key areas in which one outperforms the other. This post 
will clarify the differences so you can choose the best approach for your 
situation. 
What is supervised learning? 
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that’s defined by its use 
of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” 
algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using 
labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn 
over time. 
Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems 
when data mining: classification and regression: 
• Classification problems use an algorithm to accurately assign test 
data into specific categories, such as separating apples from oranges. 
Or, in the real world, supervised learning algorithms can be used to 
classify spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Linear classifiers, 
support vector machines, decision trees and random forest are all 
common types of classification algorithms. 
• Regression is another type of supervised learning method that uses 
an algorithm to understand the relationship between dependent and 
independent variables. Regression models are helpful for predicting 
numerical values based on different data points, such as sales revenue 
projections for a given business. Some popular regression algorithms 
are linear regression, logistic regression and polynomial regression. 
What is unsupervised learning? 
Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and 
cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in 
data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are 
“unsupervised”). 
Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, 
association and dimensionality reduction: 
• Clustering is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data 
based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-means 
clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where 
the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This 
technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression, 
etc. 
• Association is another type of unsupervised learning method that 
uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given 
dataset. These methods are frequently used for market basket 
analysis and recommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers 
Who Bought This Item Also Bought” recommendations. 
• Dimensionality reduction is a learning technique used when the 
number of features  (or dimensions) in a given dataset is too high. It 
reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also 
preserving the data integrity. Often, this technique is used in the 
preprocessing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise 
from visual data to improve picture quality. 
The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning: 
Labeled data 
The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled 
datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and 
output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. 
In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by 
iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct 
answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than 
unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to 
label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can 
predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather 
conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy 
weather extends the driving time. 
Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover 
the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some 
human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an 
unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often 
purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst 
would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to 
group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups. 
Other key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning 
• Goals: In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new 
data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an 
unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large 
volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is 
different or interesting from the dataset. 
• Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam 
detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing 
predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is 
a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer 
personas and medical imaging. 
• Complexity: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine 
learning, typically calculated through the use of programs like R or 
Python. In unsupervised learning, you need powerful tools for 
working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised 
learning models are computationally complex because they need a 
large training set to produce intended outcomes. 
• Drawbacks: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to 
train, and the labels for input and output variables require expertise. 
Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods can have wildly 
inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the 
output variables. 
 
 
Terms 
Algorithm A formula or set of rules (or procedure, processes, or 
instructions) for solving a problem or for performing a task. In Artificial 
Intelligence, the algorithm tells the machine how to find answers to a 
question or solutions to a problem. In machine learning, systems use many 
different types of algorithms. Common examples include decision trees, 
clustering algorithms, classification algorithms, or regression algorithms. 
Artificial Neuron An artificial neuron is a digital construct that seeks to 
simulate the behavior of a biological neuron in the brain. Artificial neurons 
are typically used to make up an artificial neural network—these 
technologies are modeled after human brain activity 
Backpropagation Backpropagation, also called “backward propagation of 
errors,” is an approach that is commonly used in the training process of the 
deep neural network to reduce errors. It allows the machine learning 
algorithm to adjust itself according to looking at its past function. It 
involves the calculation of errors between prediction and the target values, 
the computation of the gradient of the error function, and then the update 
of the weigh 
Data Data is a collection of qualitative and quantitative variables. It contains 
the information that is represented numerically and needs to be analyzed.  
Data Cleaning Data Cleaning is the process of identifying, correcting, or 
removing inaccurate or corrupt data records. 
Learning Learning is the process of acquiring new or modifying existing 
knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. The ability to learn is 
possessed by humans, animals, and some machines, and there is also 
evidence for some kind of learning in some plants. Some learning is 
immediate, induced by a single event but much skill and knowledge 
accumulates from repeated experiences. 
Natural Language Processing Natural language processing (NLP) is a 
method to translate between computer and human languages. 
Traditionally, feeding statistics and models have been the method of choice 
for interpreting phrases. Recent advances in this area include voice 
recognition software, human language translation, information retrieval, 
and artificial intelligence. There is difficulty in developing human language 
translation software because language is constantly changing. Natural 
language processing is also being developed to create human readable text 
and to translate between one human language and another. Already 
existing reports associated with radiology images can be used to learn 
about disease and conditions and the ultimate goal of NLP is to build 
software that will analyze, understand, and generate human languages 
naturally, enabling communication with a computer as if it were a human.  
Neural networks Also known as artificial neural network, neural net, deep 
neural net; a computer system inspired by living brains. Neural networks 
found to perform best in ImageNet data challenges were convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs). This name comes from the mathematical concept 
of convolution, which is similar to the CNN convolutional operation wherein 
filters are applied to an image in fixed spatial regions and are swept across, 
or integrated, over the entire image. The resulting activations can then be 
aggregated in pooling operations,

5,"About AI  
 
Artificial intelligence is the intelligence possessed and demonstrated by machines.  AI is the simulation 
of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. AI 
can also be applied to any machine that displays the traits applied to human mind such as learning and 
problem solving.  AI is the ability of the machines to perform certain tasks that require intelligence when 
done by humans and animals. A computer is said to have AI if it can think humanly, act humanly, think 
rationally and act rationally. The term AI was first coined by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy in 1950s 
who are known as fathers of AI. AI is a large field which composes of machine learning and deep 
learning. The most common applications of AI are robots, voice assistants, chat bots, recommendation 
systems, prediction systems, classification systems, search engines, games etc. 
Machine Learning 
Machine learning is one of the most promising approaches to AI. It allows system to perform certain 
tasks by learning from past data instead of being explicitly programmed. In ML, A computer program is 
said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if it 
performs tasks in T, as measured by P and improves with E. Components of Machine learning includes 
Data, model, learning and application. 
Types of Machine Learning: 
1) Supervised Machine Learning 
In supervised learning, you pass the samples containing the input features and their desired 
outputs to the machine learning model for training. The model then learns a mapping from the 
input features to the desired output. You aim to produce an accurate enough mapping so that 
the algorithm can predict the output as correctly as possible whenever a new test input is given. 
As the desired output passed during the training supervises the model to learn the required 
mapping, this learning method is called supervised learning 
 
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning: 
As opposed to supervised learning, in unsupervised learning, you pass the samples containing 
only the input features to the machine learning model. The model then extracts different useful 
features and patterns from the data. As the desired output is no longer supervising the learning 
process, this learning method is called unsupervised learning. 
 
3) Reinforcement Learning: 
Reinforcement Learning is the type of machine learning where the machine learns on its own 
using observations gathered from the interaction with its environment to take actions that 
would maximize the reward or minimize the risk.

6,"About AI 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the process of making machine intelligent and capable to do works 
humans do. It is a technique in which a machine becomes intelligent after experience at some 
work. It is a booming field in present time as it can be used to automate works humans do. 
Supervised Learning is a technique in AI in which the data is labelled and the data is either done 
classification or regression task.  The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns 
and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate 
labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data. Supervised learning is good at 
classification and regression problems, such as determining what category a news article 
belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In supervised learning, the 
aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question. 
In contrast to supervised learning is unsupervised learning. In this approach, the algorithm is 
presented with unlabeled data and is designed to detect patterns or similarities on its own. It 
can be done by different clustering algorithms. 
The chief difference between unsupervised and supervised learning is in how the algorithm 
learns. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data as a training set. Unlike 
in supervised learning, there are no correct output values; the algorithm determines the 
patterns and similarities within the data, as opposed to relating it to some external 
measurement. In other words, algorithms are able to function freely in order to learn more 
about the data and find interesting or unexpected findings that human beings weren't looking 
for. Unsupervised learning is popular in applications of clustering (the act of uncovering groups 
within data) and association (the act of predicting rules that describe the data).

Artiﬁcial intelligence is a conglomeration of concepts and technologies that
means different things to different people – self-driving cars, robots that
impersonate humans, machine learning, and more – and its applications are
everywhere you look. An AI is a computer system that is able to perform tasks
that ordinarily require human intelligence. These artiﬁcial intelligence
systems are powered by machine learning. Many of them are powered by
machine learning, some of them are speciﬁcally powered by deep learning,
some of them are powered by very boring things like just rules. The effects of
AI will be magniﬁed in the coming decade, as manufacturing, retailing,
transportation, ﬁnance, healthcare, law, advertising, insurance, entertainment,
education, and virtually every other industry transform their core processes
and business models to take advantage of machine learning.
Supervised learning involves machine learning algorithms that learn under
the presence of a supervisor. Learning under supervision directly translates to
being under guidance and learning from an entity that is in charge of
providing feedback through this process. Unsupervised learning is commonly
used for ﬁnding meaningful patterns and groupings inherent in data,
extracting generative features, and for exploratory purposes.
AI frameworks provide data scientists, AI developers, and researchers the
building blocks to architect, train, validate, and deploy models, through a
high-level programming interface.the CAHAI (Ad hoc Committee on Artiﬁcial
Intelligence) has explored the reasons as to why a legal framework on the

What is AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science con-
cerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically
require human intelligence.
Examples of AI are
1. Siri,Alexa
2. Self driving cars
3. Conversational Bots
4. Netflix’s recommendation

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as
a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine
using data that is well labelled.
Which means some data is already tagged
with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of
examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training
data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled
data.
Some examples of supervised learning algorithms

2. Logistic regression
3. Support vector machine

Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do
not need to supervise the model.
Instead, it allows the model to work on
its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected.
It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
allow users to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised
learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared
with other natural learning methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms include
clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks, etc.

9,"About AI: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural 
intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study 
of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that 
maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term ""artificial intelligence"" had previously been used to 
describe machines that mimic and display ""human"" cognitive skills that are associated with the human 
mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem-solving"". This definition has since been rejected by major AI 
researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how 
intelligence can be articulated. 
Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. 
Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labelled. 
Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided 
with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set 
of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled data. Unsupervised learning is the 
training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm 
to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted 
information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 
Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be 
presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on 
finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge). 
Machine learning is how AI technology learns and gets smarter on its own.In machine learning, a human 
trains a machine to achieve an outcome, using data prepared by the human. Using what it learned from the 
human, the machine then goes and tries to achieve the outcome using data it's never seen before. Every 
time the machine tries to achieve the outcome, it learns from the results—even if they're bad. And it 
applies these learnings to its next attempt. In this way, the machine uses machine learning to rapidly 
improve at a task without direct human involvement. Pattern recognition is when machines detect pattens 
in data. These patterns help machines better optimize towards outcomes, which makes pattern recognition 
a key function in machine learning. Pattern recognition is also what powers AI's predictive capabilities. A 
machine uses patterns in historical data to predict which future outcomes are most likely. Natural 
language generation is when AI writes or speaks human-sounding language. Natural language 
generation powers everything from writing tools to smart home assistants to chatbots. It makes it possible 
to converse with machines. Natural language processing is when AI interprets what human language 
means. To do NLG, a machine must use natural language processing to first understand written or spoken 
language. For instance, Google Translate uses NLP to understand the text you type, then generate its 
translation in whatever language you select. 
 
 
Image recognition is when AI accurately identifies objects in photos. Using machine learning, AI 
systems can identify objects in images with a high degree of accuracy. The AI system is trained on 
millions or billions of images to detect certain objects. Trained well, it can then go and recognize those 
objects in images it hasn't seen before. One example of image recognition used today is in radiology. AI 
is able to identify certain tumors with a high degree of accuracy better, faster, and cheaper than humans.

open-source framework that is based on neural networks that support text, message, and voice 
remodeling. It provides an efficient scaling environment due to a faster overall evaluation of the machine 
models while taking care of accuracy. Caffe is a deep learning network that comes along with the 
preloaded set of trained neural networks. This should be your first pick if your deadline is close. Known 
for its image processing capabilities, this framework also has extended support of MATLAB. Using 
GPUs in place of CPU, this framework supports deep learning research and is capable of delivering 
accuracy for networks that need high computational power. For instance, the computation of multi-
dimensional arrays requires high power, and Theano is capable of that. Theano is based on python, which 
is a proven programming language when it comes to faster processing and response.

10,"ABOUT AI 
AI is a branch of computer science that deals with making machine works like human. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence 
displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of 
intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that 
maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
 
Within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there are two basic approaches: supervised 
learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that’s 
defined by its use of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” 
algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Unsupervised learning uses 
machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover 
hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention. 
 
Adversarial machine learning is a technique employed in the field of machine learning that 
attempts to make models more robust by exposing them to adversarial (and sometimes malicious) 
input. AI frameworks make the creation of machine learning/deep learning, neural networks, and 
natural language processing (NLP) applications easier and faster by offering ready solutions. Some 
of the most popular open-source frameworks include TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, Sci-Kit, Keras, 
Microsoft Cognitive ToolKit and Apache Mahout.Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function 
that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in 
decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in AI that has networks capable of 
learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural 
learning or deep neural network. Machine learning is a branch of AI that allows systems to 
automatically process data and analyze for insights without being programmed explicitly. Machine 
learning is concerned with learning functions and patterns to do things like classification and 
prediction. NLP is concerned with information retrieval, text mining, question answering, machine 
translation, intent understanding, sentiment, emotion, tone extraction in text. It is a branch of AI 
which uses algorithms to train machines in responding to human conversations. 
 
AI frameworks provide data scientists, AI developers, and researchers the building blocks to 
architect, train, validate, and deploy models, through a high-level programming interface. 
TensorFlow is a Python library that invokes C++ to construct and execute dataflow graphs. Scikit-
learn is an open source, commercially usable AI library. Another Python library, scikit-learn supports 
both supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

11,"What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 
AI is the study of how to make computers do things which at the moment people do better. In general it 
is the branch of computer science that deals with helping machines find solutions to complex problems 
in a more human-like fashion. 
Supervised learning: 
- 
Inferring a function from training data that consists of training examples. Eg: classification 
- 
It learns from available data and predicts unforeseen data. 
Unsupervised learning 
- 
Finding hidden structure in unlabeled data. There is no distinction between explanatory and 
dependent variables. Eg: clustering

12,"About AI 
Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled 
robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like 
humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits 
associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. 
The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that 
have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine 
learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and 
adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this 
automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, 
images, or video. 
In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well “labeled.” It means some 
data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place 
in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher. A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled 
training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Successfully building, scaling, 
and deploying accurate supervised machine learning Data science model takes time and technical 
expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, Data scientist must rebuild 
models to make sure the insights given remains true until its data changes. 
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the 
model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly 
deals with the unlabeled data. 
Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared 
to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with 
other natural learning deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. 
The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many 
different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing 
drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

14,"About AI 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world. Remarkable surges in AI capabilities have 
led to a wide range of innovations including autonomous vehicles and connected Internet of Things 
devices in our homes. AI is even contributing to the development of a brain-controlled robotic arm that 
can help a paralyzed person feel again through complex direct human-brain interfaces. These new AI-
enabled systems are revolutionizing and benefitting nearly all aspects of our society and economy – 
everything from commerce and healthcare to transportation and cyber security. But the development 
and use of the new technologies it brings are not without technical challenges and risks. AI and 
Machine Learning (ML) is changing the way in which society addresses economic and national 
security challenges and opportunities. It is being used in genomics, image and video processing, 
materials, natural language processing, robotics, wireless spectrum monitoring and more. These 
technologies must be developed and used in a trustworthy and responsible manner. 
Algorithm 
An algorithm is a formula representing the relationship between certain variables. Think of algorithms 
as a simple set of instructions with a finite end designed to produce an output. An everyday example 
of an algorithm is a recipe. You have a set amount of inputs (ingredients) designed to produce a 
repeatable output — apple pie, for example. Machine learning programs in AI use algorithms to make 
predictions, and in the case of marketing, suggestions are based on algorithms that hope to target the 
user’s specific preferences (if website visitor ‘A’ visits pages for kid’s short sleeve shirts an algorithm 
will email them coupons for kid’s short sleeve shirts). 
Chatbots 
A chatbot is a program that runs within websites and apps that interacts directly with users to help 
them with simple tasks. A “conversation” happens between the user and the computer program. These 
are often currently used for customer support, but the applications for chatbots are growing. 
Cluster 
Any group of people or things that share a common characteristic. Data is combed through by AI to 
uncover patterns and connections that humans might not readily see. Clusters can be used to identify 
target segments or audiences, creating marketing opportunities through commonalities. 
Cognitive science 
The broader form of study that includes AI in addition to philosophy, linguistics, psychology, 
neuroscience, and anthropology. All of these combine together to learn how the mind functions and, 
when applied to AI, how machines can simulate human thought and action. 
Machine learning 
With limited need for programming, machines can teach themselves. Combing through massive 
amounts of data allows AI to identify patterns and groupings. This could be used to determine target 
audiences, decide on optimal times to send emails, or segment out groupings for deeper engagement. 
Deep learning 
In this advanced version of machine learning, computers actually teach themselves with minimal 
programming by humans. Marketers can use deep learning to identify data and make predictions 
related to how consumers might behave.  
Image recognition (or “computer vision”) 
One of the more complicated processes for machine learning, computers can be programmed to 
understand what is happening in an image. AI searches for patterns within images to quickly identify 
nuances that humans may not see. 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
This technology allows machines to determine what humans are saying, whether in text or by voice. 
More sophisticated programs can decipher speech in various languages, understanding not only the 
actual vocabulary, but also pulling out context and more hidden meanings. Sarcasm and subtlety are 
still difficult for AI, but advanced technology is working on it. 
Neural networks 
Structured to be similar to the human brain, this AI model incorporates natural language processing 
and deep learning to identify faces in photos and analyze handwriting. 
Semantic analysis 
A more sophisticated form of Natural Language Processing, this concept is focused on the process of 
stringing words together as well as the way that language is understood through cultural context. This 
could function as a help to create eBooks and blog posts, with the potential to replace human writers 
or content marketers (!). Wait, what? 
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the 
multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows 
you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a 
single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google 
Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting 
machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be 
applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well. 
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for 
applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Meta 
AI. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although 
the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has 
a C++ interface.  
MindSpore is the AI computing framework. Fully developed by Huawei from the ground up, it 
implements on-demand collaboration across the cloud-edge-device. It provides unified APIs and end-
to-end AI capabilities for model development, execution, and deployment in all scenarios. 
Using a distributed architecture, MindSpore leverages a native differentiable programming paradigm 
and new AI native execution modes to achieve better resource efficiency, security, and 
trustworthiness. Meanwhile, MindSpore makes full use of the computing power of Ascend AI 
processors and lowers the entry requirements of industry AI development, bringing inclusive AI faster 
to reality. 
Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is 
trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can 
detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling 
it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data. 
Supervised learning is good at classification and regression problems, such as determining what 
category a news article belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In 
supervised learning, the aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question. 
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise 
the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that 
was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. 
Unsupervised Learning Algorithms allow users to perform more complex processing tasks 
compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable 
compared with other natural learning methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, 
anomaly detection, neural networks, etc.

How does AI work?
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to pro-
mote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is
simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation
of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning
algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few,
including Python, R and Java, are popular.
In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training
data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns
to make predictions about future states.
In this way, a chatbot that is fed
examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or
an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images
by reviewing millions of examples.
AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and
self-correction.
processes: This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and
creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules,
which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step in-
structions for how to complete a specific task.
Reasoning processes: This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing
the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
Self-correction processes: This aspect of AI programming is designed to con-
tinually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results
possible.

to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that

Supervised learning 
 
Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. 
Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well 
labelled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the 
machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm 
analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled 
data. 
  
  
Unsupervised learning 
 
Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor 
labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of 
the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences 
without any prior training of data.  
Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the 
machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by 
itself.

Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects 
such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the 
creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites. n a few words, web 
development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. 
Sharing of ideas as well as operate at any type of level on issue just how little or large is the 
prime purpose offered by developers of internet sites. It might begin with the grass-root 
academic level and rise to professional levels. Creating your very own websites has actually 
come to be so practical now with the help of devices such as PHP Programs. With a website that 
is developed in an excellent fashion, firms, and also companies as well as market their product or 
services conveniently and also skillfully as well as help to improve their services. 
Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software 
packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a 
traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone. 
In this article, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about the basics of web 
development which include front-end and back-end. 
Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when 
you visit a website or use a web application. Front-End Developers create everything you see on 
a web page, including: 
• 
Colors 
• 
Layout 
• 
Navigation 
Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a website that you can't see, particularly 
how website information is stored and retrieved. 
When you access a webpage in your browser, you're essentially requesting to see a file stored on 
a server somewhere. When you load a webpage for the first time or sign into a website with a 
username and password, it's Back-End Developers who make it possible to access website 
information efficiently and securely. 
 
 
A web framework is a code library that makes web development quicker and easier by giving 
basic patterns for building reliable, scalable and maintainable web applications. Web frameworks 
exist to make it easier for the developer to make a web application. 
Here are several web frameworks that have been designed to make coding and app development 
much easier for those in the industry. A few of the most popular and successful web frameworks 
include: 
• 
Django  
• 
Ruby on Rails 
These frameworks assist codes such as HTML, Ruby, and Python when it comes to constructing 
web applications and web-based services. There are a variety of things that can be done with a 
web framework, such as the generation of HTML, the formation of default templates, and the 
ability to access a library of coding information to keep code simple and automated each time a 
developer makes a new web application.

5,"Web Development 
 
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide 
Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple 
single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social 
network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly 
refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client 
liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-
commerce development. 
 
Among Web professionals, ""Web development"" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of 
building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development 
may use content 
management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical 
skills. 
 
For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of 
people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while 
developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting 
developer, 
or 
secondary 
assignment 
to 
related 
job 
positions 
such 
as 
a graphic 
designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort 
between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of 
Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack 
developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user 
browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the 
Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has 
boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever. 
 
Importance of Web Development 
As human beings, we pride ourselves on our superb adaptation skills and ability to change with 
the times. Stemming from this, when the social world shifted from a place of interpersonal 
connections to internet connections, so did the world of business. There's no getting around it; 
our digitally-driven lifestyle has given us little choice but to adapt to technology, and if you 
haven't already, it's time to get a move on. It's a no-brainer; website development is now essential 
to you as a business person. For your business to generate more business, your voice needs to be 
heard, your brand needs to be seen, and your goals need to be reached. Website development is 
the key to making those things happen. The same way an eye is the window to the soul, a 
website is the window to the business, giving customers a taste of what you have to offer and 
enticing them to delve deeper for more. 
 
We are simple creatures in that we like convenience, and there's nothing more convenient than 
accessing a whole host of information by simply clicking a button, which is what millions of 
people do when they go online every day. If your product can't be found on the other side of that 
click, you've already lost access to those millions of people, and your company effectively 
doesn't exist. In conjunction with this, establishing a strong web presence as a business while 
reaching millions of internet surfers who might become potential clients will elevate your 
product to a universally compatible entity, even if the service you provide is physically localized 
to a specific place. So what kind of information is valuable to showcase on your website, in order 
to leave a maximal impact? 
 
 
Front-end Development 
Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app 
that a user will interact with (the client side). Meanwhile, back end development focuses on the 
side of a website users can’t see (the server side). They work together to create a dynamic 
website to allow users to make purchases, use contact forms, and any other interactive activities 
you might participate in while browsing a site. Some examples of dynamic websites are Netflix, 
PayPal, Facebook, and the Kenzie Academy site you’re currently on. 
 
Back-End Development 
 
Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, 
website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any 
action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code 
written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information. 
 
Frontend Vs. Backend 
When you’re coding, you’ll use a programming language. Much like human languages, these 
languages allow programmers to communicate with their computers through a series of symbols 
(referred to as code). Very simply, it’s like giving your computer instructions. Front end 
developers work in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
 
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language for creating 
webpages.  
 
CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create structure on a site, CSS 
is used to bring style and flair. It defines a site’s colors, fonts, and the style of other site content.  
 
JavaScript is a language that can be used to make a site interactive and fun. You can use it to run 
a game on your site, to name one example.  
Front end also works in its own set of frameworks and libraries. Here are just a few of the 
frameworks and libraries a front end developer would work with:  
 
AngularJS 
 
React.js 
 
jQuery 
 
Sass 
Back end developers work in languages like PHP, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and 
Node.js. Here’s a bit more on a few of these languages:  
 
PHP is a server-side scripting language.  
 
Java is a highly popular platform and programming language.  
 
Python is a general-purpose coding language. It’s different from some of the others we’ve 
mentioned here because it can be used for other kinds of software development and isn’t limited 
solely to web development.  
Back end frameworks include: 
 
Express 
 
Django 


Framework 
A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build 
and manage web applications, web services and websites. 
Such a framework includes templating capabilities for presenting information within a browser, 
the programming environment for scripting the flow of information and the application 
programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing underlying data resources. The framework also 
provides the foundations and system-level services for software developers to build a content 
management system (CMS) for managing digital information on the Web. Developers can use 
the framework to define the 'out-of-the-box' content management capabilities, user authentication 
features, and administrative tools.  
A web development framework can be built upon a pre-defined infrastructure such as the Linux, 
Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) stack.Once defined and implemented the core CMS features 
and functions can be difficult to modify.

intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain 
text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive 
list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers may include Web engineering, Web design, Web 
content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security 
configuration, and e-commerce development. 
The website development process defines the functionality, applicability, and general functioning of your 
website. A user-friendly user interface on a website will result in a considerably greater conversion rate, 
which will translate into more business and profits. This is accomplished through the use of exceptional web 
design on a developer's website. Optimization of the website to increase its search engine presence will 
guide this decision-making process. Web design enables you to build and maintain consistency across all 
sections of your website, which is important for SEO. 
  
The company owner can select the photographs that will be used by contacting a competent web designer. 
SEO is a critical component of the web building process that must be handled with attention. Through this 
optimization, the website appears when different searches are entered into the search engine. This means 
the website receives more hits from search engine results pages and increases its visibility. The amount of 
money a business makes is directly proportional to the volume of sales it produces. 
  
The creation and effective promotion of a website may help a business attract more customers and increase 
sales. According to the research, eCommerce operations climbed by 21.3 percent in the previous calendar 
year. A well-designed website is essential for reaching a larger audience and generating more leads or 
customers. A pleasant user experience and an easy-to-understand website design will encourage customers 
to spend more time on your website and learn more about the products and services you provide. Web 
development and design help to promote a company's brand name. 
  
Profits and revenues rise as a result of this development. The same method may be used by using ReactJS 
development services for blogs or any other custom web development service, such as Adobe Illustrator or 
Photoshop.

Development does not necessarily focus on a website‘s design; rather, it is
majorly concerned with the programming and coding part, which is the main
reason for the functioning of the website.
It refers to developing and maintaining web pages, including bits and

database management. Further, it includes various types of web development
tools and techniques such as text editors for manually coding the websites,
Dreamweaver for developing a web page, using a blogging website to update
blogs, and more.
Web Development frameworks are created by Developers to make it easier
to develop and work with various programming languages. These frameworks
basically remove all the redundant and difficult tasks that are involved in
the process of setting up a web page. The frameworks either do the tasks
themselves or make it easier for Developers to complete those tasks.
The frontend refers to technologies presented on the front side of a website
or a web application, meaning it‘s a client-facing interface for users to move
around with elements like a computer browser, buttons, and text.
The backend refers to the technology and interface that runs in the back-
ground of a website or web application to either produce a completely server-
facing interface or make the frontend possible. The backend is server-facing,
often never seen by users.

3. Full stack web development
Frontend web development
Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with 
them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques 
used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be 
aware of how the field is developing.
Backend web development
Backend Development is also known as server-side development. It is everything that the users don’t 
see and contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It 
focuses primarily on databases, backend logic, APIs, and Servers.
Full stack web development
Development of both frontend and backend of web i.e. both client-side and server-side development.
Web development frameworks
A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build and 
manage web applications, web services and websites.
Such a framework includes templating capabilities for presenting information within a browser, the

developing web pages along with a complete working framework. Web development refers in 
general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or internet. 
The web development process includes web design, web content development, client-
side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks. In a broader 
sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to build, 
maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are 
optimal. Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, 
per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, 
which includes coding and writing markup. Web development ranges from creating plain text 
pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications and electronic business 
applications. Web development is important as it can easily reach to customers and reach new 
audiences. Any working web system comprises of two components namely frontend and 
backend which is called full stack. Frontend refers to the display (web pages) that are visible 
to audience i.e. that are shown on the web browser. The part of a website that the user interacts 
with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. 
It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and 
tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages 
used for Front End development. The structure, design, behaviour, and content of everything 
seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is 
implemented by front End developers. Backend refers to the subsystem that is residing in the 
server and its task is to make overall system work. Backend is responsible for instructing 
frontend. Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes 
sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that 
you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct 
contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are 
indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, 
creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even 
systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend. With the development of 
numerous frameworks based on different programming languages, developing web 
applications has become significantly easier. That is one of the reasons for the high demand to 
hire backend developers and front-end developers. Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, . NET, etc., 
are a few prominent backend languages. React, Vue, Ember, Bootstrap, and Angular are the 
most famous front-end frameworks. Django, Ruby On Rails, Spring, Express, ASP.NET Core. 
There are various frameworks like Django, Laravel, Express etc are used for development.

public in 1991. 
net assets may be any sort of downloadable media. web pages are files 
interconnected with the aid of hypertext links formatted in Hypertext 
Markup Language (HTML). The HTML syntax shows embedded links 
with URLs, which lets in users to navigate to different web resources. 
similarly to textual content, internet pages may additionally comprise 
references to pictures, video, audio, and software program additives, that 
are either displayed or internally executed inside the consumer's net

Web development refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining
websites and web applications that run online on a browser. Web development is closely
related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often
called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual
construction  and  programming  of  websites  and  apps.  The  basic  tools  involved  are
programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style
Sheets), and JavaScript. 
Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you
are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to
buy or use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors.
Displaying this information  with  high-quality  images  and  thought-out presentation  will
have a large influence on customers, and it is important to strive towards making your
product as relatable and appealing as possible. Additionally, with website development
you can: Communicate with your visitors effectively, Improve your connectivity, Prove your
reliability.
It mainly has two parts associated with it frontend and backend. Front end development is
a style of computer programming that focuses on the coding and creation of elements and
features of a website that will then be seen by the user. It’s about making sure the visual
aspects of a website are functional. You can also think of front end as the “client side” of
an application. So let’s say you’re a front end developer. This means your job is to code
and bring to life the visual elements of a website. You’d be more focused on what the user
sees when they visit a website or app. And, you’d want to make sure the site is easy to
interact with while also running smoothly. Back end development focuses on the side of
the website users can’t see. It’s what makes a site interactive. You can also refer to the
back end as the “server side” of a website. For instance, let’s say you’re running a social
media website. You need an accessible place to store all of your users’ information. This
storage center is called a database and a few widely used examples include Oracle, SQL
Server,  and  MySQL.  Databases  are  run  from  a  server,  which  is  essentially  a  remote
computer. A back end developer will help manage this database, as well as the site
contents stored on it.
There  are  various  frameworks  for  web  development  such  as  HTML,  CSS,  React,  Vue,
Ember,  Bootstrap,  Angular  for  frontend  and  Django,  Ruby  On  Rails,  Spring,  Express,

The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages
that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet,
and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of
servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web
does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same. 
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or
an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static
page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A
more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,

your company's qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality
images and thought-out presentation will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to
strive towards making your product as relatable and appealing as possible. Additionally, with website
development you can:
1. Communicate with your visitors effectively. Interacting with your audience is vital when it comes to
generating more business. It is viable to make a website that enables you to get in touch with your
customers and prospects, and you can produce valuable content for the audience associated with the
industry or business you're in. Afterwards, post the content on your blog, share it on social media
networks and respond to customers' comments and feedback promptly. This will show your clients the
extent to which you’re concerned about their satisfaction and responsive to their needs.
2. Improve your connectivity. A website will facilitate things like expanding your reach and attracting
more visitors to your business. Planning to make a responsive website design for your site will help
make  it  accessible  to an  extensive  range  of users  spanning  several  devices,  such as  tablets  or
smartphones. This will increase both your site's exposure and organic traffic.
3. Prove your reliability. A website offers a straightforward method of showing the credibility of a
business, and the way a person represents his business online is vital for attracting more customers or
visitors. Therefore, your website design should be handled in the best possible way, because a
professional presentation speaks volumes as testimony to your business. With the help of website
development, you can add your skills, credentials, experience, expertise and more in a single place.
These details help you earn the trust and confidence of your visitors and serve as a reference point for
customers interested in your business, making it easy for you to produce leads.
If you are a developer or you want to become one, there are plenty available web development
positions in leading development job search websites.
To sum up, it's pretty clear that website development plays a big role in successful business marketing.
Without it, it would be very difficult to leave your mark on a global level. So make life easier for
yourself! Start adapting, develop a website, and get ready to collect the benefits of your success.
Front End and Back End: Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web
development. These terms are very crucial for web development but are quite different from each other.
Each side needs to communicate and operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the
website’s functionality. 
Front End Development: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front
end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users
experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation
menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. The structure,
design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications,
or  mobile  apps  are  opened  up,  is  implemented  by  front  End  developers.  Responsiveness  and
performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is
responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave
abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen. 
Front end Languages: The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed
below: 
HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of
web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text
documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to
simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.
More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
JavaScript: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site
interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and
web-based software.
There are many other languages through which one can do front-end development depending upon the
framework for example Flutter user Dart, React uses JavaScript and Django uses Python, and much
more.
Front End Frameworks and Libraries: 
AngularJS: AngularJs is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop
single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which
provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML.
It is an open-source project which can be free. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is
bound with HTML.
React.js: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Flutter: Flutter is an open-source UI development SDK managed by google. It is powered by Dart
programming language. It builds performant and good-looking natively compiled applications for
mobile (Ios, Android), web, and desktop from a single code base. The key selling point of flutter is flat
development is made easier, expressive, and flexible UI and native performance. In march 2021 flutter
announce Flutter 2 which upgrades flutter to build release applications for the web, and the desktop is
in beta state.
Some other libraries and frameworks are Semantic-UI, Foundation, Materialize, Backbone.js, Ember.js,

Backend Development: Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also
makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you
cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the
users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users
through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with
system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also
included in the backend. 
Back end Languages: The back end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed
below: 
 
PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP
code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
